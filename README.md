The amazon product sentiment is a popular NLP project in the Machine Learning industry. In this digitalized world e-commerce is taking the ascendancy by making products available within the reach of customers where the customer doesn't have to go out of their house. As now a day's people are relying on online products so the importance of a review is going higher.
