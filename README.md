# Sentiment_Analysis
## Project Description
The amazon product sentiment is a popular NLP project in the Machine Learning industry. In this digitalized world e-commerce is taking the ascendancy by making products available within the reach of customers where the customer doesn't have to go out of their house. As now a day's people are relying on online products so the importance of a review is going higher. For selecting a product, a customer needs to go through thousands of reviews to understand a product. But in this prospering day of machine learning, going through thousands of reviews would be much easier if a model is used to polarize those reviews and learn from it. We used supervised learning method on a large scale amazon dataset to polarize it and get satisfactory accuracy.

## Problem Statement
The online business is hugely affected by the ratings and reviews users provide on online forums. These reviews aid merchants and producers to moniter the customer behaviour towards their product. But in this prospering day of machine learning, going through thousands of reviews would be much easier if a model is used to polarize those reviews and learn from it. There is the need to build a machine learning model that can easily categorize a customer's sentiment once the review is entered.
